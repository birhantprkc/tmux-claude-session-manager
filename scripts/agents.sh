# Emit one picker row per running Claude that lives in a tmux pane.
#
# Claude self-reports its status: each session writes its own state to disk. We
# read those files, falling back to `claude agents --json`. So this needs no
# Claude Code hooks, and no `pane_current_command` scan — on macOS a pane reports
# its parent shell there, never the `claude` child running inside it.
#
# Identity is the Claude process, not the tmux session. Joining pid -> tty -> pane
# is what lets several Claudes in one project (same cwd, same session, different
# windows) each get a row of their own.
#
#   Row: rank \t pane_id \t pid \t kind \t icon \t age \t loc \t path
#   rank/pane_id/pid/kind are hidden from the display via fzf's --with-nth.
